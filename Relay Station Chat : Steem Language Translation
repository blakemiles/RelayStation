Questions/Commentary:
- this sets the stage for a potential real-time chat translation platform utilizing Steem accounts
- encourages mutli-lingual training with real incentives
- poorly translated material can only be downvoted by other translators of that language pair
- language competency test required?
- may need to be built as a sidechain that allows for API pulls from Steemit.com based on user language preference
- may require a bot to interact with the original post and translated post(s)
- what will define the reward split for edits/amednments/notes voting of follow-on translators?
- will user be able to define the rewards explicitly? recommended default?
- in-line 'post content field' instructions for RelayStation?
